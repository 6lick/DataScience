    "This assignment is due on Moodle by **5 PM on Friday June 15**. Your solutions to theoretical questions should be **done in Markdown/MathJax** directly below the associated question.  Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your instructors and classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**. \n",

    "- It is **bad form** to make your reader interpret numerical output from your code.  If a question asks you to compute some value from the data you should show your code output **AND** write a summary of the results in Markdown directly below your code.\n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells in a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do Cell $\\rightarrow$ Run All as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",

    "In this problem you will write some code to simulate the game of **Miniopoly** (a very rough approximation of [Monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)).  The game consists of a round board with 40 \"squares\" numbered from $0$ to $40$, where squares $0$ and $40$ are [coincident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincident) and called **GO**.  A player starts on **GO** with \\$200 in their pocket.  On each turn the player rolls a pair of dice and then moves a number of spaces equal to the sum of the dice.  Landing on different squares have different results: \n",
